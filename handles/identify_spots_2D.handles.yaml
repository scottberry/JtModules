      help: >
        Grayscale image in which spots should be detected.

    - name: spot_size
      type: Numeric
      value: 5
      help: >
          Approximate size of spots (diameter in pixels). A Laplacian of
          Gaussian filter of this size will be used to enhance the radial
          signal of that size.

    - name: rescale_quantiles
      type: Sequence
      value: [0.01, 0.99]
      help: >
          Prior to spot detection the images are rescaled according to their
          intensity using quantiles. [0 1] would correspond to using the
          single dimmest pixel for minimal intensity and the single brightest
          pixel for maximal intensity. [0.01 0.90] would mean that the minimum
          intensity is derived from the 1% brightest pixel and that the
          maximum intensity is derived from the 90% brightest
          pixel.

    - name: rescale_thresholds
      type: Sequence
      value: [0, 120, 500, 0]
      help: >
          Most extreme values that the image intensity minimum and image
          intensity maximum (as defined by the quanta) are allowed to
          have [LowestPossibleGreyscaleValueForImageMinimum
          HighestPossibleGreyscaleValueForImageMinimum
          LowestPossibleGreyscaleValueForImageMaximum
          HighestPossibleGreyscaleValueForImageMaximum].
          To ignore an individual value, and use per-image quantile
          rescaling, place 0.

    - name: detection_threshold
      type: Numeric
      value: 0.02
      help: >
          Threshold for spot detection intensity in rescaled image on a scale
          of 0-1 (default: 0.02). Spots in the rescaled / LoG-filtered image
          with intensity below this value will not be detected.

    - name: deblending_steps
      type: Numeric
      value: 30
      help: >
          The number of deblending steps used to separate adjacent spots.
          Note that the number of deblending steps is the main determinant
          of computational time for this module.

          Labelled spots from segmentation before deblending. Use as a
          mask for measuring spot intensity.

    - name: spots_deblend

          Labelled centroids of spots identified in the image after
          deblending. Use to count spots.
