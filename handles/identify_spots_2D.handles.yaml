        Grayscale image in which spots should be detected.

          Binary or labeled image of objects in which spots should be
          detected (e.g. cell segmentation image).

    - name: spot_size
      type: Numeric
      value: 5
      help: >
          This value corresponds to the approximate size of you spots. It should
          be their diameter in pixels. The LoG will use a mask of this size to
          enhance radial signal of that size. Note that in practice the specific
          value does not affect the number of spots, if spots are bright (eg.
          pixel size 5 or 6).

      type: Numeric
      value: 0.01
      help: >
          Prior to spot detection the images are rescaled according to their
          intensity. Since the specific value of minimal and maximal intensities
          are frequently not robust across multiple images, intensity quantile are
          used instead. [0 1] would correspond to using the single dimmest pixel
          for minimal intensity and the single brightest pixel for maximal
          intensity. [0.01 0.90] would mean that the minimum intensity is derived
          from the pixel, which is the 1% brightest pixel of all and that the
          maximum intensity is derived from the pixel, which is the 90% brightest
          pixel.

    - name: detection_threshold
      type: Numeric
      value: 0.02
      help: >
          Threshold for spot detection intensity in rescaled image (default:
          ``0.02``). The higher the value, the more stringent spot detection is.

    - name: deblending_steps
      type: Numeric
      value: 20
      help: >
          The amount of deblending steps, which are done. The higher it is the less
          likely it is that two adjacent spots are not separated. The default of 30
          works very well (and we did not see improvement on our images with higher
          values). Note that the number of deblending steps is the main determinant
          of computational time for this module.
